			<div class="question">
				<h2>How is Farmer Bob's made?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>We started by working with veterinary nutritionists who helped us formulate our balanced and complete, human-grade recipes. Then we carefully source our wholefood ingredients from local, Australian suppliers and cook them at low temperatures at our HACCP accredited human-grade facility before hand packing and sending them off to you!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>Where are the ingredients sourced from?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>We source our meat from local farms in Australia. Our beef is corn-fed and comes from humanely-treated cattle. Our chicken is 100% vegetable-fed and neither has any added hormones. Our produce, seeds and oils are carefully sourced and there’s absolutely no by-product, fillers, artificial flavoring or preservatives in our food. Ever.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do I know the food is safe?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>We don’t outsource our food production. We make it in a human-grade facility in Sydney. We adhere to HACCP standards, just like companies that make food for you. And because we’re obsessed with the quality, we test every batch of meals before sending them to you.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>Do I have to prepare anything?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Nope! We’ve done all the prep work for you—we sourced the fresh ingredients, studied which nutrients dogs need, and tailored the recipe to your dog’s unique needs. All you have to do is store it in the fridge and feed your dog the amount prescribed!</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>Should I consult my vet before feeding my dog Farmer Bob’s?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Our recipes have been formulated by a veterinarian with nutritional expertise and are complete and balanced, so you shouldn’t have to consult your vet if your dog is healthy. You can rest assured that your dog is getting all the nutrients necessary to thrive in the precise amount he or she needs. If your dog has specific health issues or has had trouble with what they’ve been fed in the past, always play it safe and talk to your vet first.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>How do shipments work?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>With our meal plans, customers receive deliveries of freshly prepared food on a recurring basis either fortnightly or monthly. Meals are customized to fit your dog’s needs and come in convenient serving packs to make feeding easy. We perfectly time deliveries to make sure you never run out of food.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>How much does this cost?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>Each dog is different, and pricing will depend on a variety of factors including age, weight, activity, and more. Fill out our questionnaire to determine your costs! We don’t use any retail stores unlike the big brands, so your dollars go more towards your dog’s ingredient quality, and not to all the middlemen.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>What if my dog doesn’t like it?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>If your dog doesn’t like one of our recipes, send it back or donate the package to a local dog shelter. We’ll happily send you another one or refund you in full.</p>
				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="question">
				<h2>How should I make the switch to Farmer Bob's?</h2>
				<div class="answer">
					<p>We highly recommend following our transition guidelines so you give your dog’s stomach flora time to adjust to the new type of diet. It may take your dog’s digestive tract up to two weeks to adjust, especially if they have eaten kibble their entire life. Switching to real, fresh ingredients is a big change, but it’s 100% better for their health in the long run. We include a transition guide in each shipment for you to follow.</p>
