    <ol>
      <li>
After completing the subscription or order process on farmerbobs.com.au, you will receive an e-mail from us acknowledging that we have received your order. Please note that this does not mean that your order has been accepted.
</li>
      <li>The Contract will relate only to the Product or Service you have ordered or subscribed to.

</li>
      <li>Following the promotional subscription period of half, one, three, six or twelve months, your farmerbobs.com.au subscription will be automatically extended for at the then-current non-promotional subscription rate.</li>
      <li>We reserve the right at our absolute discretion not to renew your subscription at any time without giving any reasons for our decision.</li>

There will be no refunds for any late cancellations.</li>
